# Cleaning-Rediff-Data
A set of steps in PDF format which details the activity I performed in the Big Data laboratory of the MCA dept in the entirety 
of 4th semester.

The practical pertained to cleaning and performing analytics on a '3 lac' something dataset of Rediff News Articles.

The dataset 'Rediff News Articles' mostly had textual data.

The PDFs contain the code(if there is for that activity) as well as description on what the code does.
